Welcome to the **AI-Powered-Text-to-Image-Generator-** This project leverages the power of the Stable Diffusion model to generate stunning images from text prompts. Whether you're an artist, developer, or enthusiast, this tool allows you to create high-quality images effortlessly..............



## 🚀 Features

- **Pre-trained Stable Diffusion Model**: Utilizes the `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` model for high-quality image generation.
- **Optimized for Speed & Memory**: Uses half-precision (`fp16`) and the Euler discrete scheduler for faster and more efficient processing.
- **NSFW Filter Disabled**: Allows unrestricted image generation by disabling the safety checker.
- **GPU Support**: Automatically utilizes CUDA if available for enhanced performance.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Simple command-line prompts make image generation straightforward.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **CUDA**: If using a GPU, ensure CUDA is installed and properly configured
